## Installation

I plan to put this in the Chrome Web Store, but for now just download the repo and install as an unpacked extension

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file and extract it.

2. Type `chrome://extensions` into your url bar and press `return`. ![alt](https://screenshot.click/10-55-pcupg-60pvl.jpg)

3. Turn on `Developer Mode` which will show some extra actions under the search bar.

4. Click on `Load Unpacked`

5. Select the repo or the unzipped folder that you created in step 1.

6. That's it. You're good to go! 

## Updates
Until it is published on the Chrome Web Store, when updates are release you will either need to run `git pull` or download the new zip file and replace the current folder with the new one
